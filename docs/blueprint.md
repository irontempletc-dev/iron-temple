## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700), symbolizing excellence and achievement within the Iron Temple programs. (Reasoning: The user specified gold, so it is being used as the primary color)
- Background color: Desaturated gold (#FAF7E5), creates a muted, elegant backdrop that doesn't detract from the content.
- Accent color: Blue (#4682B4), adds a contrasting, professional touch that complements the gold and signifies trust and knowledge. (Reasoning: The user specified blue, so it is being used as the accent)
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif for readability and modern aesthetic.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' sans-serif, with thin-thick lines, for elegance, and a high-end feel; use 'PT Sans' for longer text. 
- Use custom-designed icons that align with the Iron Temple brand, and effectively convey the meaning of each training module and feature. 
- Implement a card-based design for training modules that organizes the content, while promoting an uncluttered and engaging interface.
